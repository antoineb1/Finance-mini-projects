The objective of this mini-project is to design a portfolio based on the principles outlined in this article: https://institutdeslibertes.org/les-cycles-longs-dans-la-gestion-de-portefeuille/. 

The approach adopted thus aims to take advantage of long economic cycles to optimize asset allocation. Moreover, the Sharpe ratio will be used as a key indicator to assess the portfolio's risk-adjusted performance and ensure a balanced asset allocation between return and volatility.
